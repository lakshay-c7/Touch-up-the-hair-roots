# Touch-up-the-hair-roots
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to transform minority hair colors into the majority hair color in images. By combining K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, we've created a robust pipeline capable of delivering high-quality hair color modifications
