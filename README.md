# Touch-up-the-hair-roots
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to transform minority hair colors into the majority hair color in images. By combining K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, we've created a robust pipeline capable of delivering high-quality hair color modifications
GETTING STARTED
To get started, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the README.md. We've provided detailed documentation to help you deploy the model and use the pipeline effectively.
REQUIRMENTS
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
Gradio
USAGE
Simply upload an image, and the pipeline will process it to convert the minority hair color into the majority hair color while preserving the natural look of the hair.
